IPL 2021 RCB beat MI by 2 Wickets – AB de Villiers’ super-human 27-ball 48 and Harshal Patel’s five-wicket haul helped RCB chase a 160-run target in the last ball to get a winning start in the IPL 2021. Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli won the toss and sent Rohit Sharma’s Mumbai Indians to bat first. Despite Chris Lynn’s 49, Mumbai could only post 159 in 20 overs.

On a rather slow pitch, RCB bowlers were off to a good start, keeping it tight. For Mumbai, despite two boundaries, they lost Hitman Rohit Sharma early in the 4th over. But Chris Lynn, returning to the MI squad after sitting out the entire IPL 2020 campaign, was on song. His 49-run knock, laced with 4 fours and 3 sixes, at a time looked dangerous for RCB.
                    
However, Kyle Jamieson brought RCB back into the game with three good overs on debut. As Suryakumar Yadav started building on his good start, Jamieson scalped him soon. MI soon lost Lynn and Hardik Pandya, making it difficult to post a big total. In the end, it was Harshal Patel’s fantastic spell of 4-0-27-5 that helped RCB restrict Mumbai for 159/9 in 20 overs. It was also the first fifer for any bowler against Mumbai Indians.

In the chase, Kohli surprised many by bringing in Washington Sundar as his opening partner instead of Rajat Patidar. The duo was off to a good start after Rohit Sharma dropped Sundar off the second ball. But Krunal Pandya scalped Sundar in the fifth over to give MI the breakthrough. Debutant Rajat Patidar did not last long either. Then on, Glenn Maxwell and Kohli anchored the innings.

But Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah and Marco Jansen brought Mumbai back into the game with quick wickets. However, AB de Villiers with a fine 27-ball 48 kept RCB in the game. Despite his late run-out, RCB managed to chase the target in the last ball, winning the match by 2 wickets. The loss meant Mumbai Indians’ opening game jinx continued.

IPL 2021, CSK vs DC Highlights: Delhi Capitals (DC) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their first match of the tournament by seven wickets with eight balls to spare. DC chased down a total of 189 on the back of the fifties from Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw. The openers put on a partnership of 138. Shaw scored 72 whereas Dhawan scored 85. In the end, skipper Pant finished the match in style. This was DC’s highest successful run chase against CSK in the history of IPL.

Earlier Rishabh Pant won the toss against CSK and elected to field first at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. DC fast bowlers started off well with the new ball getting rid of Faf du Plessis and Ruturaj Gaikwad. However, Suresh Raina played like his usual self in the comeback match scoring a half-century. Moeen Ali did well on his CSK debut as well scoring 36 batting at No.3. CSK lost a few wickets in the middle overs but they bat deep. Unfortunately for CSK, Raina fell victim to a mix-up with Ravindra Jadeja as he got run out for 54. But, Jadeja and Sam Curran ensured that CSK finish well and their 51-run partnership for the seventh wicket helped the team post a total of 188/7. Avesh Khan was the pick of the bowlers for DC as he picked two wickets for 23 runs in his four overs including Du Plessis and MS Dhoni.
